                "reasoning_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many people can be seated when four square tables are pushed together in a row. Let me start by visualizing the setup.\n\nFirst, a single square table seats four people, one on each side. When tables are joined in a row, the way they connect will affect the total number of seats. If two tables are pushed together, the sides where they connect become adjacent and might not have chairs. But wait, maybe the tables are placed side by side along one edge. Let me think.\n\nEach table has four sides. If you put four tables in a straight line, each adjacent pair of tables shares a side. So, for each connection between two tables, two sides are merged. Let's break it down.\n\nFor one table: 4 people.\nAdding a second table next to it: The second table has 4 sides, but the side adjacent to the first table is now internal. So each additional table after the first might add 3 new sides (since one side is merged). Wait, but maybe each connection blocks two seats. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to think about the total perimeter. A single square table has 4 sides. When you put two tables together in a line, they form a longer rectangle. Each table has a length and width. Let's assume each table is a square, so length and width are equal. When you put four together in a row, the total shape would be a rectangle that's four times as long as one table's side, but the same width.\n\nSo the perimeter of a single square table is 4 sides. When four are joined in a row, the combined shape is a rectangle with length 4 units and width 1 unit. The perimeter of such a rectangle is 2*(4+1) = 10 units. But each unit here corresponds to a side of the original table. But how does that relate to seating?\n\nWait, each side of a table can seat one person. But when tables are joined, the sides that are connected don't have seats. So for each internal connection between two tables, two seats are lost (one from each table's adjacent side). Let me test this with two tables.\n\nTwo tables in a row: Each table has 4 seats. But when joined, the adjacent sides (one from each table) are merged. So total seats would be 4 + 4 - 2 = 6. Wait, because each table originally has 4 seats, but the two seats where they connect are removed. So 4*2 =8 minus 2*1 (each connection removes two seats) gives 6. Wait, but actually each connection would have two sides (one from each table) that can't have seats. So each connection removes 2 seats. For two tables, 1 connection, so 4*2 - 2*1 = 8 -2=6. Then for four tables, there are three connections. So total seats would be 4*4 -2*3= 16-6=10. But wait, that gives 10. But maybe that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, when arranging tables in a line, the first and last tables have two exposed sides (front and back) but the ones in the middle only have one. Wait, maybe the seating is along the long sides. Let me think again. Each square table has four seats. When you push them together in a line, the sides that are adjacent are merged. So for the combined structure, the two ends each have two seats (front and back), and the long sides (left and right) would have seats. Wait, maybe not. Let's imagine each table is a square, so when you put them in a row, the combined shape is a long rectangle. The perimeter of the rectangle would be 2*(length + width). If each original table is 1x1, then four in a row would be 4x1. The perimeter is 2*(4+1)=10. But each unit of perimeter corresponds to a seat. Wait, maybe each side of the table (each edge) can seat one person. So for a single table, 4 edges, 4 people. For four tables arranged in a line (4x1 rectangle), the perimeter is 10 edges, so 10 people. But that seems high. Wait, but in reality, when you place tables together, the seats are only on the outer edges. So for each table, the inner edges (where they connect to another table) don't have seats. So the total seats would be the sum of the outer perimeter edges. Let's calculate that. The combined table is 4 units long and 1 unit wide. The perimeter is 2*(4+1)=10 units. So 10 seats. But wait, the original single table has 4 seats, which is the perimeter (4 units). So that seems to fit. So if four tables in a row make a perimeter of 10, then 10 seats. But the answer might be different. Let me check with two tables. Two tables in a row: perimeter is 2*(2+1)=6. So 6 seats. Which matches the earlier calculation (4+4-2=6). So then four tables would indeed have 10. But wait, maybe the problem is not considering the ends. Wait, maybe the ends of the row are also seats. For example, each table has four seats, but when you push them together, you remove two seats per connection. But the ends still have their seats. Let me try with two tables again. Each table has four seats. When you push two together, the two adjacent sides (where they connect) can't have seats. So each table loses one seat. So total is 4 +4 -2=6. Which matches. Then three tables would have 4*3 -2*2=12-4=8. Four tables: 4*4 -2*3=16-6=10. So that gives 10. But another way, the perimeter calculation gives the same result. So the answer would be 10. But wait, the original problem says \"four tables of this kind together in one row\". Let me think again. Another way: imagine each square table has seats on all four sides. When you place them in a row, the sides that are adjacent between tables can't have chairs. So the first table has 4 seats. The second, third, and fourth tables each have two seats (since one side is connected to the previous table and one side is connected to the next, except for the last table). Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it mentally. The first table has seats on all four sides. When you add a second table next to it, the adjacent side (let's say the right side of the first table and the left side of the second) are merged. So each of those sides loses a seat. So first table now has 3 seats (since one side is connected), and the second table has 3 seats (since one side is connected). But if we connect them in a straight line, maybe each subsequent table after the first has two new seats. Wait, that might not be right. For example, first table: 4 seats. Adding a second table next to it, the second table has 4 seats, but the side where it's connected to the first table can't have a seat. So second table contributes 3 new seats. But the first table's connected side also loses a seat. Wait, no. The first table's right side is connected, so it loses one seat (from 4 to 3). The second table's left side is connected, so it loses one seat, but the other three sides are available. So total for two tables: 3 +3 =6. Then adding a third table, the third table loses one seat (left side connected), so contributes 3. Total 3+3+3=9? But that contradicts the previous method. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, when you connect tables, each connection removes two seats (one from each table). So for each connection between two tables, two seats are lost. So for four tables in a row, there are three connections. Each connection removes two seats. So total seats would be (4 tables *4 seats) - (3 connections *2 seats) =16-6=10. So that's 10. But another approach: the first table has 4 seats. Each additional table added to the row adds 2 seats (since they lose one on each end). Wait, let's see. First table: 4 seats. Second table: when connected, it loses one seat (the side connected to the first table), so adds 3 seats. Total 4+3=7? Wait, that's different. This is confusing. Let's take it step by step.\n\nImagine each table is a square with seats on all four sides. When you place them in a row, each subsequent table is placed adjacent to the previous one, so their adjacent sides are merged. For the first table, all four sides are available: 4 seats. The second table is placed to the right of the first. The left side of the second table is adjacent to the right side of the first. So those two sides (right of first, left of second) can't have seats. So the first table now has 3 seats (loses one), and the second table has 3 seats (loses one). Total after two tables: 3+3=6. Adding a third table: it's placed to the right of the second. The third table's left side is merged with the second's right side. So the third table contributes 3 seats (loses one). Total 3+3+3=9. Fourth table: same way, contributes 3. Total 12. But this contradicts the earlier method. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, according to this, four tables would have 4 +3+3+3= 13? No, first table 4, second 3, third 3, fourth 3: total 4+3+3+3=13. But that can't be right. Because when you have four tables in a row, the two ends each have a seat, and the long sides have seats. Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the combined structure has two long sides (top and bottom) and two short ends (left and right). Each long side can seat as many people as the number of tables, but maybe each table contributes one seat per long side. Wait, maybe each table's top and bottom are available. For four tables in a row, the top and bottom would each have four seats. The left and right ends each have one seat. So total seats: 4 (top) +4 (bottom) +1 (left end) +1 (right end) =10. That matches the perimeter calculation. So that's 10. So the answer is 10. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement allows for some seats at the ends where tables are connected. Wait, no, because when tables are pushed together, the adjacent sides are merged, so no chairs there. So the total seats would be the sum of the outer edges. Which for a 4x1 rectangle is perimeter 10, so 10 seats. Therefore, the answer is 10. But wait, the problem says \"four tables of this kind together in one row\". Let me check another example. If you have three tables in a row, perimeter would be 2*(3+1)=8, so 8 seats. Which would be 3 tables: 3*4=12, minus 2*(2 connections) =4, 12-4=8. That matches. So yes, the formula is 4n - 2(n-1) where n is the number of tables. Simplifies to 4n -2n +2=2n+2. Wait, 4n -2(n-1)=4n-2n+2=2n+2. So for n=4: 2*4 +2=10. That's correct. So the formula is 2n+2. So for n=1: 4, n=2:6, n=3:8, n=4:10. That makes sense. Therefore, the answer is 10.\n",
